# ITMO Speaker Recognition Course

**Authors:** Volokhov V., Lavrentyeva G., Novoselov S., Matveev Y.

**Description:** the project is related to the development of labs for the ITMO Speaker Recognition Course.

**Keywords:** voice biometrics, speaker recognition, speaker verification, speaker identification, acoustic features, speech activity detector, machine learning, speaker embedding extractor, deep neural network, decision theory, domain adaptation and calibration.

**Datasets:** the main databases for performing of labs is [VoxCeleb corpus](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/).

**Content:** the repository contains materials (now only in russian language) for self-performing five labs. The titles of the labs are listed below.

- **Lab work 1.** Informative features of speech signals: feature extraction ([link](https://github.com/itmo-mbss-lab/sr_labs_book/tree/main/lab1)).
- **Lab work 2.** Voice activity detector training                           ([link](https://github.com/itmo-mbss-lab/sr_labs_book/tree/main/lab2)).
- **Lab work 3.** Creating and comparing speaker models                      ([link](https://github.com/itmo-mbss-lab/sr_labs_book/tree/main/lab3)).
- **Lab work 4.** Decision criteria and quality metrics                      ([link](https://github.com/itmo-mbss-lab/sr_labs_book/tree/main/lab4)).
- **Lab work 5.** Adaptation and calibration of speaker recognition system   ([link](https://github.com/itmo-mbss-lab/sr_labs_book/tree/main/lab5)).

**Some ideas for creating of labs** were borrowed [here](https://voicebiometry.org/) (training of voice activity detector model), [here](https://github.com/clovaai/voxceleb_trainer) (training and testing of speaker embedding extractor) and [here](https://github.com/alumae/sv_score_calibration) (training of calibration model for voice biometrics system). 

**A published version of these labs** (now only in russian language) can be found [here](https://books.ifmo.ru/file/pdf/3087.pdf). Publication date: 05/24/2022.
